# Objection Handling Cheat Sheet
## Quick Reference for TAG Markets Sales Calls

---

## THE GOLDEN RULE
**Don't fight objections. Acknowledge → Redirect → Prove**

---

## TRUST & LEGITIMACY

### "Is this a scam?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "I get why you'd ask. Three things: 1) TAG is licensed by Mauritius FSC - verify it yourself. 2) Results are on Myfxbook - a third-party site I don't control. 3) I'm giving YOU $25. Scammers take money, they don't give it."

**Key Proof Points:**
- Licensed broker (Mauritius FSC)
- Myfxbook verification (anyone can check)
- You're funding their account, not taking money
- Withdrawals anytime

---

### "Is this MLM / pyramid scheme?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "No. The test is simple: can you make money without recruiting anyone? Yes - from trading profits. That's the difference. MLM requires recruiting. This doesn't."

**Key Proof Points:**
- Profits come from forex market, not recruitment
- Can join, never refer anyone, still profit
- Referral program ≠ MLM (Amazon, Uber have them too)

---

### "Why should I trust you?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Don't trust me. Trust the data. Go to Myfxbook right now and verify the results yourself. I'm not asking for blind faith - I'm showing you third-party proof."

**Key Proof Points:**
- 15+ months track record
- Third-party verified results
- 301 trades documented
- You're risking $0

## MONEY CONCERNS

### "I don't have money to invest"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Perfect - that's exactly why I'm funding your account. You put in $0. I give you $25. You keep the profits. If you can't afford to invest, this is made for you."

---

### "What if I lose the $25?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Then you lose nothing - it wasn't your money. I'm the one taking the risk. You're literally playing with house money."

---

### "$25 is too small to matter"
**Quick Answer:**
> "$25 with 24x amplification = $600 trading power. At 1.23% monthly, that's about $7-8/month. Small? Yes. But it proves the system works with zero risk. Once you see it work, you can add more."

---

## SKEPTICISM ABOUT RESULTS

### "Sounds too good to be true"
**Quick Answer:**
> "I thought so too. Then I checked Myfxbook - third party verified. 20.23% gain over 15 months. 80% win rate. 0.86% drawdown. These aren't my numbers - anyone can verify them. Go look right now."

---

### "Past results don't guarantee future results"
**Quick Answer:**
> "True for everything in life. But would you rather bet on 15 months of verified data, or something with no track record? And remember - you're betting with my $25, not yours."

---

### "How do I know Sonic AI will keep performing?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "I don't know the future. Nobody does. What I know: 3 traders, 10+ years experience each, 15+ months consistent results, 0.86% max drawdown. That's the best track record you'll find. And you're testing it risk-free."

---

## STALLING / PROCRASTINATION

### "I need to think about it"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Fair enough. What specifically do you need to think about? [Listen] Here's the thing - what's the downside of trying something that costs you $0? Every day you wait is potential profits missed."

---

### "I need to ask my spouse/partner"
**Quick Answer:**
> "I respect that. What do you think they'll be concerned about? [Address it] The thing is - you're not spending any money. You're just opening an account. If it doesn't work out, there's nothing to explain because you lost nothing."

---

### "Let me do more research"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Absolutely. Here's where to look: Myfxbook for results, TAG Markets website for licensing. I'll send you both links. But research won't change the facts - 15 months of verified results and zero risk to you. When do you want to reconnect?"

---

### "Maybe later / not the right time"
**Quick Answer:**
> "When would be the right time? Here's the thing - there's no 'perfect time.' And the longer you wait, the more potential gains you miss. If you had started 3 months ago with $100, you'd have an extra $90 right now. When does 'later' become 'now'?"

---

## PAST EXPERIENCES

### "I tried trading before and lost money"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Me too. That's exactly why I don't trade myself anymore. I let professionals do it. Your past losses were probably: trading alone, B-book broker, undercapitalized. This fixes all three."

---

### "I got burned by something similar before"
**Quick Answer:**
> "What happened? [Listen] I'm sorry that happened. This is different because: 1) Results are third-party verified - not screenshots. 2) I'm funding your account - not asking for money. 3) You can withdraw anytime - no lock-ups. But I understand if you need to see it work first. That's why I'm giving you $25 to test."

---

## COMPARISON OBJECTIONS

### "I can get better returns elsewhere"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Where? Show me 15 months of verified results with 80% win rate and 0.86% drawdown. I'll wait. [Pause] The difference is VERIFIED. Anyone can promise returns. This is proven."

---

### "Why not just trade myself?"
**Quick Answer:**
> "You can. 90% of retail traders lose money. Do you have 10+ years experience, a proven system, and time to watch markets all day? If yes, go for it. If not, why not let professionals do it while you test with my $25?"

---

### "My friend said crypto/stocks are better"
**Quick Answer:**
> "Maybe. What's their verified track record? Can you check it on a third-party site? Do they offer 24x amplification? Will they fund your account? Compare apples to apples."

## WHEN TO WALK AWAY

Not everyone is a fit. Walk away if:
- They're clearly not interested after addressing concerns
- They become hostile or disrespectful
- They're looking for guaranteed returns (red flag client)
- They keep making excuses after you've addressed everything

**Exit Line:**
> "I understand this isn't for everyone. No hard feelings. If anything changes, you have my contact. Good luck with whatever you decide to do."

---

## REMEMBER

1. **Facts > Feelings** - Always bring it back to verified data
2. **Questions > Statements** - Ask what's really holding them back
3. **Silence is Golden** - Let them think after big points
4. **Zero Risk is Your Superpower** - You're funding their account
5. **Don't Beg** - If they don't see the value, move on
