## PART 1: OPENING (2-3 minutes)

### Build Rapport First
```
Hey [Name], good to finally connect! Can you hear me okay? Great.

Before we jump in, tell me a bit about yourself - where are you based
and what do you do?

[Let them talk - listen for pain points about money, time, job frustration]
```

### Set the Frame
```
Cool, thanks for sharing that. So here's what I want to do today:

I'm going to show you something that's been working really well for me
and my team. I'll be straight with you - I'm not going to hype anything
or promise you'll get rich overnight. That's not how this works.

What I AM going to show you is:
1. A real trading system with verified results you can check yourself
2. How you can get started with zero risk - I literally fund your account
3. And if it makes sense for you, how to move forward

Sound fair? Cool, let's go.
```

## PART 2: DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (5-7 minutes)

### Understand Their Situation
```
Before I show you anything, I need to understand where you're at.

1. Have you ever traded before? Forex, crypto, stocks - anything?
   [If yes] How did that go?
   [If no] No worries, most people haven't. That's actually fine for this.

2. What's your current situation with money? Are you comfortable, or
   are you looking for ways to build extra income?

3. If I showed you something that could realistically make you
   $50-200/month passively - would that move the needle for you?

4. What's holding you back from achieving your financial goals right now?
   [Listen for: time, knowledge, capital, fear, past failures]

5. If this actually works - and I'll prove it does - what would you do
   with that extra money?
```

### The Key Insight
```
Here's what I've learned: Most people fail at trading because they either:
- Don't have enough capital to make it worthwhile
- Don't have time to learn and watch charts all day
- Or they let emotions destroy their account

What if I told you there's a way to solve all three of those problems?
```

## PART 3: THE PRESENTATION (15-20 minutes)

### Part A: The Problem with Traditional Trading
```
Let me share my screen real quick.

[Share screen - show any trading chart]

See this? This is what most people think trading is - staring at charts,
trying to guess if it goes up or down. 90% of retail traders lose money.
That's a fact.

Why? Because:
- They're trading against their broker (B-book brokers profit when you lose)
- They don't have enough capital (can't survive the normal ups and downs)
- They trade emotionally (fear and greed destroy accounts)
- They don't have an edge (no system, no strategy)

I'm not here to teach you how to trade charts. That's a losing game for
most people.
```

### Part B: The Solution - TAG Markets + Sonic AI
```
Instead, let me show you what I do.

[Share TAG Markets dashboard or presentation]

This is TAG Markets - one of the fastest growing forex brokers in the world.
Here's why it's different:

1. A-BOOK BROKER
   They don't trade against you. When you win, they don't lose.
   Most brokers are B-book - they're literally betting against you.
   TAG is A-book, licensed by Mauritius FSC, 75 liquidity providers.

2. AMPLIFIED ACCOUNTS
   This is the game changer. Instead of trading with just your money,
   TAG gives you 24x amplification.

   So if you deposit $100, you're trading with $2,400.
   That means your profits are 24x bigger too.

   Let that sink in.

3. SONIC AI - THIS IS THE KEY
   [Open Myfxbook tab]

   Now here's where it gets interesting. Instead of YOU trading,
   you connect to Sonic AI - a team of 3 professional traders with
   10+ years experience each.

   Look at this - this is Myfxbook, a third-party verification site.
   This is NOT a screenshot I made. Anyone can verify this.

   [Point to stats]
   - +20.23% total gain since November 2024
   - 1.23% average monthly return
   - 80% win rate
   - 0.86% max drawdown (that means very low risk)
   - 301 trades, $23,705 in profits

   This is real. Verified. Public. You can check it yourself right now.
```

### Part C: The Math (Make It Real)
```
Let me show you the math. This is where people's eyes open.

[Use calculator or write on screen]

Let's say you start with just $100:
- Your deposit: $100
- 24x amplification: $2,400 trading power
- Monthly return (1.23% on $2,400): ~$30/month
- That's 30% return on YOUR $100

Now scale that up:
- $500 deposit = $12,000 trading power = ~$150/month
- $1,000 deposit = $24,000 trading power = ~$300/month

And remember - you keep 70% of profits. 5% goes to the traders,
25% goes back to the community.

Where else can you get 30% monthly returns with verified track record?
```

### Part D: Your Zero-Risk Offer
```
Now here's what I'm going to do for you.

I know you might be skeptical. I was too. So here's my offer:

I will personally deposit $25 into your account.
Not a loan. Not credit. Real money. My money.

You get:
- $25 funded by me
- 24x amplification = $600 trading power
- Connected to Sonic AI automatically
- You keep 100% of the profits

Your risk? Zero. You're not putting in a single dollar.

If it works - great, you've got a system that makes you money.
If it doesn't - you lost nothing. I lost $25.

Why would I do this? Because I know it works. And when you see it work,
you'll want to add more capital. That's how I build my team.

I'm betting on the results, not on convincing you with words.
```

---

## PART 4: OBJECTION HANDLING (as needed)

### "Is this a scam?"
```
I get it. The internet is full of scams. Let me address that directly.

First - TAG Markets is licensed and regulated by Mauritius FSC.
You can verify that on their website.

Second - The trading results are on Myfxbook. That's a third-party site
I don't control. Go check it yourself right now if you want.

Third - I'm funding YOUR account with MY money. If this was a scam,
why would I give you $25? Scammers take money, they don't give it.

Fourth - You can withdraw your profits anytime. No lock-ups, no tricks.

I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asking you to verify the facts.
```

### "Is this MLM/pyramid scheme?"
```
No. Here's the difference:

MLM = You make money by recruiting people who recruit people.
The product is secondary.

This = You make money from TRADING. The profits come from the forex market,
not from recruiting.

Yes, TAG has a referral program - most companies do. Amazon has one.
Uber has one. That doesn't make them pyramid schemes.

You can join, never refer anyone, and still make money from trading.
That's the test. If you can make money without recruiting, it's not a pyramid.
```

### "I don't have money to invest"
```
That's exactly why I'm funding your account.

You don't need money. I'm giving you $25 to start.

If you can't afford $25, then this is perfect for you - because you're
getting it for free.

Start with my $25, let it grow, then decide if you want to add more.
```

### "I need to think about it"
```
Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think about?

[Listen to their real concern]

Look, I'm not trying to pressure you. But let me ask you this:

What's the downside of trying something that costs you $0?

If you're waiting for the "perfect time" - there isn't one.
If you're worried about risk - there is none, I'm funding it.
If you need to ask someone - who? And what will they know about this
that you don't after seeing the verified results?

The only thing you can lose here is time. And every day you wait is
a day of potential profits you're missing.
```

### "I tried trading before and lost money"
```
Me too. Most people have.

That's exactly why I don't trade myself anymore. I let the professionals
do it through Sonic AI.

Your past losses were probably because:
- You were trading yourself without a system
- You were using a B-book broker betting against you
- You didn't have enough capital to survive drawdowns

This fixes all three. Professional traders, A-book broker, amplified capital.

Your past experience actually makes you the perfect person for this -
because you know how hard it is to do it alone.
```

### "How do I know the results will continue?"
```
I don't. Nobody can guarantee future results. Anyone who does is lying.

What I CAN show you is:
- 15+ months of verified track record
- 301 trades with consistent results
- Professional team with 10+ years experience each
- Risk management with only 0.86% max drawdown

Past performance doesn't guarantee future results - that's true for
everything. But would you rather bet on 15 months of verified results,
or something with no track record at all?

And remember - your risk is $0. You're testing with my money.
```

### "What if I lose the $25?"
```
Then you lost nothing - because it wasn't your $25.

I'm the one taking the risk here, not you.

And honestly? Based on 15 months of data, the chance of losing is low.
But even if it happens, you're no worse off than you are right now.
```

## PART 5: THE CLOSE (3-5 minutes)

### Trial Close
```
So let me ask you directly:

Based on what you've seen - the verified results, the zero risk,
the fact that I'm funding your account - does this make sense to you?

[Wait for answer]

What questions do you still have before we get you started?
```

### The Close
```
Great. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll send you my referral link for TAG Markets
2. You create an account (takes 5 minutes)
3. Complete KYC verification (ID + selfie)
4. Message me on WhatsApp when done
5. I deposit $25 into your account
6. We connect you to Sonic AI together
7. You start seeing trades happen automatically

Can you do that today? The sooner we set it up, the sooner you start
seeing results.

What's your WhatsApp number so I can send you the link?
```

### If They're Still Hesitating
```
Look, I've shown you everything. The results are verified. The risk is zero.

At this point, the only thing stopping you is yourself.

You can go back to your normal day, wonder "what if," and stay exactly
where you are financially.

Or you can take 5 minutes to set up an account, let me fund it, and
see what happens.

A year from now, you'll either be glad you started today, or you'll
wish you had.

Which one do you want to be?
```

---

## PART 6: POST-CALL

### If They Sign Up
```
Awesome! I'm excited for you. Here's what to do:

1. Check your WhatsApp - I just sent you the registration link
2. Use this link specifically - it connects you to my team
3. Complete the registration and KYC today if possible
4. Message me as soon as you're verified
5. I'll fund your account within 24 hours

Welcome to the team. This is going to be good.
```

### If They Need More Time
```
No problem. I'll send you some info to review:

1. The link to check Sonic AI results yourself
2. My website with the offer details
3. My WhatsApp so you can reach me when ready

Take your time, but don't take forever. This offer won't last forever,
and every day you wait is potential profits missed.

Talk soon.
```
